# Strava On-This-Day

This ~is~ **will be** a single-page application to display your historical activities from Strava, specifically those which were recorded on this day in prior years.

The app is not currently accessible anywhere, but hopefully will be on Netlify later.

### Potential Future

See [enhancements](https://github.com/kr-matthews/strava-on-this-day/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) on GitHub.

- Automatic login via Strava, or basic walk-through to manually get required tokens from Strava, if necessary/feasible.
- Simple UI displaying applicable activities, with little functionality besides panning and zooming the map(s).

## Original Intentions

- Fetch data from an API.
- Handle tokens and credentials securely.
- Simple and minimal UI.
- Something that's actually (slightly) useful, compared to previous game-based projects.

## Focus

- Working with APIs and severless functions.
- Handling tokens within a single-page application.
