# Activities On-This-Day

This ~is~ _will be_ a single-page application working with a serverless function to display your historical activities from Strava, specifically those which were recorded on this day in prior years.

The app should be accessible at [https://activities-on-this-day.netlify.app/](https://activities-on-this-day.netlify.app/).

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e79fc32d-de94-409e-935d-7403775536bd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/activities-on-this-day/deploys)

**Note that this is NOT an official Strava app, and is NOT endorsed by Strava.**

### Potential Future

See [enhancements](https://github.com/kr-matthews/activities-on-this-day/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) on GitHub.

- Automatic login via Strava, or basic walk-through to manually get required tokens from Strava, if necessary/feasible.
- Simple UI displaying applicable activities, with little functionality besides panning and zooming the map(s).

## Original Intentions

- Fetch data from an API.
- Handle tokens and credentials securely.
- Simple and minimal UI.
- Something that's actually (slightly) useful, compared to previous game-based projects.

## Focus

- Working with APIs and severless functions.
- Handling tokens within a single-page application.
