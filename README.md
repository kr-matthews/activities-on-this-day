### Potential Future

See [enhancements](https://github.com/kr-matthews/strava-on-this-day/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) on GitHub.

- Automatic login via Strava, or basic walk-through to manually get required tokens from Strava, if necessary/feasible.
- Simple UI displaying applicable activities, with little functionality besides panning and zooming the map(s).

## Original Intentions

- Fetch data from an API.
- Handle tokens and credentials securely.
- Simple and minimal UI.
- Something that's actually (slightly) useful, compared to previous game-based projects.

## Focus

- Working with APIs.
- Handling tokens within a single-page application.
